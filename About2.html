        <p class = "ffont2">Coldplay’s full-length debut Parachutes (2000) sold millions on the strength of
            Martin’s vocals and such singles as the bittersweet “Yellow.” Parachutes earned 
            the band its first Grammy Award, for best alternative album, and paved the way
            for the more ambitious A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002). The latter album 
            earned the group two more Grammy Awards, and singles such as “Clocks” helped
            drive the band’s total album sales over the 20 million mark. Coldplay 
            followed the concert album Live 2003 (2003) with X & Y (2005), a collection
            of guitar-driven, arena-friendly rock anthems (including the hit single “Speed of Sound”) 
            that elevated the group to the rank of such “big bands” as U2 and Radiohead. Meanwhile,
            Martin’s 2003–16 marriage to American actress Gwyneth Paltrow earned him celebrity 
            status independent of his musical achievements. The band’s 2008 release, Viva la Vida, 
            produced in part by Brian Eno, topped the charts in the United States and the United 
            Kingdom, and the album’s title track, arguably Coldplay’s most radio-friendly effort
            yet, was the number one single on both sides of the Atlantic. That popularity was 
            reflected at the 2009 Grammy Awards ceremony, where the band collected honours for 
            song of the year, best rock album, and best pop performance by a group. Working 
            again with Eno, Coldplay returned with the sleek Mylo Xyloto (2011), which notably 
            featured a duet between Martin and pop singer Rihanna. Later releases included the 
            subdued Ghost Stories (2014), which yielded the hit singles “Magic” and “A Sky 
            Full of Stars”; the upbeat A Head Full of Dreams (2015); and the EP Kaleidoscope (2017). 
            To mark the release of Everyday Life (2019), Coldplay performed two live-streamed concerts, 
            one at sunrise and the other at sunset, in Amman, Jordan. It was the band’s eighth album 
            to reach the top spot on the British album chart.</p>
