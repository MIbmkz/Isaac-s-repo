                <p class = "ffont">Coldplay was formed in 1998 at University College, London, with the pairing of pianist-vocalist Chris Martin (b. March 2, 1977, Exeter, England) and guitarist Jonny Buckland (b. September 11, 1977, London). The band was later filled out with fellow students Guy Berryman (b. April 12, 1978, Kirkcaldy, Scotland) on bass and Will Champion (b. July 31, 1978, Southampton, England), a guitarist who later switched to drums. Coldplay penetrated the U.K. Top 100 in 1999 with the single “Brothers & Sisters” on the independent Fierce Panda label before signing with major label Parlaphone.</p><br>
